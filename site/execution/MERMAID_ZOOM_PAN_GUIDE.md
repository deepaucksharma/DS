Zoom and pan functionality has been successfully enabled for all Mermaid diagrams using the `mkdocs-panzoom-plugin`.

## How to Use Zoom & Pan

### Desktop Controls
| Action | Method |
|--------|--------|
| **Enable Zoom/Pan** | Hold `Alt` key |
| **Zoom In** | `Alt` + Mouse Wheel Up |
| **Zoom Out** | `Alt` + Mouse Wheel Down |

## Configuration Details

### Requirements.txt
```txt
mkdocs-panzoom-plugin>=0.1.0
```

### mkdocs.yml
```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - mermaid2:
      # Mermaid configuration
      ...
  - panzoom  # Must be AFTER mermaid2
```

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Detection**: The plugin automatically detects and enhances all Mermaid diagrams
2. **State Persistence**: Zoom state is saved in browser localStorage per diagram
3. **No Code Changes**: Existing diagrams work without modification
4. **Lightweight**: Minimal performance impact

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/deepak/DS/site
   make serve
   ```

2. **Navigate to any page with Mermaid diagrams**:
   - Example: http://127.0.0.1:8000/systems/netflix/architecture/
   - Example: http://127.0.0.1:8000/patterns/micro-patterns/

3. **Test zoom and pan**:
   - Hold `Alt` key
   - Use mouse wheel to zoom
   - Click and drag to pan

## Troubleshooting

### Diagrams not zooming?
- Ensure you're holding the `Alt` key
- Check that JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Build errors?
- Ensure `panzoom` plugin is listed AFTER `mermaid2` in mkdocs.yml
- Run `pip install mkdocs-panzoom-plugin` to ensure it's installed

## Benefits for Atlas Project

1. **Large Architecture Diagrams**: Essential for viewing complex system architectures
2. **Detailed Flow Diagrams**: Zoom in to read specific metrics and labels
3. **Presentation Mode**: Zoom out for overview, zoom in for details
4. **3 AM Debugging**: Quickly navigate complex diagrams during incidents

## Summary

The Atlas Distributed Systems Architecture Framework now has full zoom and pan support for all 321+ Mermaid diagrams, enabling engineers to effectively navigate complex architectural visualizations during both planning and emergency debugging sessions.
