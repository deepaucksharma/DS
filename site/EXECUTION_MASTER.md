- **Actual metrics** (not "high performance")
- **Specific technologies** with versions
- **Failure scenarios** and recovery procedures
- **Cost information** where applicable
- **4-plane color scheme** (no exceptions)

### Example: GOOD vs BAD

‚ùå **BAD - Academic Theory**
```
Client ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Microservice ‚Üí Database
```

‚úÖ **GOOD - Production Reality**
```
iPhone App (2M DAU) ‚Üí Kong Gateway (p99: 10ms) ‚Üí
Order Service (Java 17, 200 threads) ‚Üí
PostgreSQL 14 (db.r6g.2xlarge, 1000 connections)
```
