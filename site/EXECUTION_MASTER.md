## Production-First Atlas: 900 Battle-Tested Distributed Systems Diagrams

### üéØ The Prime Directive
**Every diagram must help someone fix a production issue at 3 AM.**

If it doesn't help during an incident, during debugging, during capacity planning, or during architecture decisions - it doesn't belong here.

---

## üìä Production Reality: The Numbers

> **üìà Live Metrics**: See `/site/data/CENTRAL_METRICS.json` for current status
>
> All project metrics are centrally tracked and updated via scripts.
> Run `python scripts/unified_status_tracker.py --dashboard` for latest numbers.

### Streamlined Approach
- **Parallel Agents**: 5+ agents working simultaneously
- **Velocity**: 350+ diagrams/session (proven)
- **Quality**: Relational thinking, visual-first
- **Focus**: Real incidents, actual metrics, production configs

### Key Changes from Streamlining
- ‚úÖ Deleted 7 redundant specification files
- ‚úÖ Merged overlapping content (40% reduction)
- ‚úÖ Created INCIDENT_RESPONSE_INDEX.md for emergencies
- ‚úÖ Converted verbose text to visual tables
- ‚úÖ Applied relational composition framework

---

## üîÑ Review & Update Workflow (NEW)

### The Challenge
With 887 diagrams already created and significant changes made to readonly-spec, we need a systematic approach to review and update existing content while continuing new creation.

### Dual-Track Execution
1. **Track 1: Review & Update** (40% effort)
   - Review existing diagrams against new specs
   - Update outdated content
   - Ensure consistency with visual-first approach

2. **Track 2: New Creation** (60% effort)
   - Continue creating missing diagrams
   - Focus on gaps (incidents, debugging guides)
   - Maintain momentum toward 900 target

### Review Priority Matrix
| Priority | Category | Reason | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| **üî¥ HIGH** | Pre-visual diagrams | Created before visual-first spec | Complete redesign |
| **üü° MEDIUM** | Stream Plane refs | Obsolete 5-plane architecture | Update to 4-plane |
| **üü¢ LOW** | Working diagrams | Already production-quality | Minor adjustments |

### Unified Tracking Workflow
```bash
# Monday: Unified Status Check (2 hours)
python scripts/unified_status_tracker.py --scan  # Update all statuses
python scripts/unified_status_tracker.py --dashboard  # View comprehensive status
python scripts/batch_diagram_reviewer.py --report  # Detailed compliance report

# Tuesday-Thursday: Dual-Track Execution
# Track 1: Review & Update Existing
python scripts/batch_diagram_reviewer.py --category systems  # Review by category
python scripts/unified_status_tracker.py --mark-reviewed <file>  # Mark completed

# Track 2: Create New Diagrams
# Continue with missing diagrams per unified dashboard

# Friday: Progress & Planning
python scripts/unified_status_tracker.py --dashboard  # Final weekly status
python scripts/unified_status_tracker.py --export weekly_report  # Export for records
```
