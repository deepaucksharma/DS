## War Room Quotes from CTOs

> **Netflix CTO**: *"AWS gave us the foundation to scale from startup to 230M subscribers. The partnership isn't just vendor-customer, it's strategic alignment."*

> **Spotify CTO**: *"GCP's BigQuery changed how we think about data. What took days on Redshift now takes minutes. Our recommendation engine improved 40% after migration."*

> **Dropbox CTO**: *"Moving off AWS saved us $75M over two years, but it took 200 engineers. Most companies should never attempt this."*

> **Airbnb CTO**: *"Multi-cloud is our reality. AWS for core platform, GCP for ML, Azure for enterprise customers. Each cloud has its sweet spot."*

*"Choose AWS for safety and scale, GCP for innovation and analytics, Azure for enterprise integration. All three are production-ready - the question is which aligns with your team's DNA."* - Former Google Cloud VP of Engineering

The cloud wars are won in the details: pricing models, regional availability, service integrations, and team expertise. Pick the cloud that amplifies your team's strengths, not the one with the flashiest demos.
