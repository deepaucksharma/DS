## Key Success Factors

### 1. Gaming-First Architecture
- Voice latency optimized for real-time gaming
- Regional servers near gaming population centers
- Custom protocols optimized for gaming patterns
- Integration with game APIs and platforms

### 2. Community Network Effects
- Server-based architecture scales with engagement
- Higher engagement = higher infrastructure efficiency
- Community moderation reduces operational costs
- Viral growth reduces acquisition costs

### 3. Freemium Conversion Optimization
