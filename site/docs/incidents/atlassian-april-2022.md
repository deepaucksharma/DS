```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause: Script Logic Error
- **Issue**: Maintenance script incorrectly identified active accounts as "inactive"
- **Logic Flaw**: Script used "last login > 180 days" criteria during pandemic (reduced usage)
- **Impact**: 400+ enterprise accounts marked for deletion despite active subscriptions

### Contributing Factors

1. **Insufficient Testing**
   - Script tested only on staging environment with dummy data
   - No production-like data volume testing
   - Missing dry-run mode for verification

2. **Inadequate Safeguards**
   - No confirmation step for bulk deletions
   - Missing account value validation (enterprise vs. free)
   - No rollback mechanism built into script

3. **Backup System Failures**
   - Point-in-time backups incomplete for user metadata
   - Cross-table relationships not properly backed up
   - Manual restoration required due to complex schema dependencies

## Technical Deep Dive

### Database Schema Impact

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USERS ||--o{ USER_PERMISSIONS : has
    USERS ||--o{ USER_PROJECTS : assigned
    USERS ||--o{ USER_SESSIONS : owns
    USERS ||--o{ BILLING_ACCOUNTS : linked

    USERS {
        uuid user_id PK
        string email
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp last_login
        boolean is_active
        boolean is_deleted
    }

    USER_PERMISSIONS {
        uuid permission_id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        string resource_type
        string permission_level
    }

    USER_PROJECTS {
        uuid assignment_id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        uuid project_id FK
        string role
        timestamp assigned_at
    }

    BILLING_ACCOUNTS {
        uuid account_id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        string subscription_type
        decimal monthly_value
        timestamp expires_at
    }
```

### Deletion Cascade Impact
- **Users table**: 400+ enterprise accounts marked `is_deleted = true`
- **User_permissions**: 50,000+ permission records deleted via CASCADE
- **User_projects**: 25,000+ project assignments deleted
- **Billing_accounts**: $2M/month in subscription value affected

## Recovery Procedures

### Phase 1: Immediate Response (Hours 1-6)
1. **Incident Declaration**
   - PagerDuty alert to engineering leadership
   - Emergency war room established
   - Customer support prepared with holding messages

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - Query database for affected accounts
   - Identify enterprise vs. free tier impact
   - Calculate business impact ($6M+ revenue at risk)

### Phase 2: Recovery Planning (Hours 6-48)
1. **Backup Analysis**
   ```sql
   -- Identify available backup points
   SELECT backup_timestamp, backup_size, completion_status
   FROM backup_metadata
   WHERE backup_timestamp >= '2022-04-03'
   ORDER BY backup_timestamp DESC;
   ```

2. **Recovery Strategy Decision**
   - Point-in-time restore to April 3, 23:59 UTC
   - Accept data loss for new accounts created April 4
   - Manual restoration due to schema complexity

### Phase 3: Execution (Days 2-14)
1. **Batch Restoration Process**
   ```python
   # Simplified restoration script
   def restore_customer_batch(customer_ids, restore_point):
       for customer_id in customer_ids:
           # Restore user account
           restore_user_account(customer_id, restore_point)

           # Restore permissions
           restore_user_permissions(customer_id, restore_point)

           # Restore project assignments
           restore_project_assignments(customer_id, restore_point)

           # Validate data integrity
           validate_account_consistency(customer_id)

           # Notify customer of restoration
           send_restoration_notification(customer_id)
   ```

2. **Manual Validation Steps**
   - Verify account login functionality
   - Check project access permissions
   - Validate billing account linkage
   - Test core application features
