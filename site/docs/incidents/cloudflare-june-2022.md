## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause: Regional Power Grid Instability

**Technical Details**:
The root cause was a series of power grid failures across multiple European regions, affecting data centers that shared regional power infrastructure.

```
Power Infrastructure Analysis:
Region: Central Europe
Affected Grid Zones:
- Zone A: Frankfurt, Berlin (Primary failure)
- Zone B: Amsterdam, Paris (Secondary failure)
- Zone C: London, Madrid (Tertiary impact)

Power Failure Timeline:
12:15 UTC: Zone A primary grid failure
12:25 UTC: Zone B backup grid overload
12:35 UTC: Zone C grid instability cascade
13:30 UTC: All zones affected by rolling failures

Root Cause: Extreme heat wave + peak AC load + grid maintenance
Contributing Factor: Insufficient power diversity across regions
```

**Cascading Impact Chain**:
1. Regional power grid experienced extreme load due to heat wave
2. Scheduled maintenance reduced grid capacity during peak demand
3. Multiple data centers lost primary power simultaneously
4. UPS and backup generator systems overwhelmed by duration
5. Cascading shutdowns affected 19 data centers across 6 countries
6. Remaining global capacity insufficient for rerouted European traffic

### Contributing Factors

1. **Geographic Power Concentration**
   - Too many data centers dependent on interconnected European power grids
   - Insufficient power source diversity across regions
   - Backup power systems not designed for extended multi-site outages

2. **Capacity Planning Limitations**
   - Global traffic rerouting capacity not sized for total European loss
   - Load balancing algorithms not optimized for extreme traffic concentration
   - Cache warming procedures inadequate for rapid capacity shifts

3. **Environmental Factors**
   - Extreme heat wave increased cooling demands
   - Peak summer air conditioning load stressed power grids
   - Scheduled grid maintenance reduced available capacity
