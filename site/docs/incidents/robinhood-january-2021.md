## The Bottom Line

**This incident revealed that retail trading platforms are constrained by the same capital requirements as institutional firms, but with dramatically different capital bases.**

The Robinhood-GameStop crisis demonstrated that extreme market volatility can effectively shut down retail access to markets through clearing house capital requirements. The incident highlighted the hidden infrastructure dependencies that can break the democratization of trading.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Clearing house capital requirements can instantly halt trading
- Extreme volatility creates systemic liquidity crises
- Retail trading platforms need institutional-level capital reserves
- Communication during trading restrictions is critical for trust
- Financial infrastructure needs transparency for retail investors

**The $1B question:** How much capital should retail trading platforms hold to ensure market access during the next GameStop-level event?

---

*"In production, financial infrastructure is only as democratic as its weakest capital requirement."*
