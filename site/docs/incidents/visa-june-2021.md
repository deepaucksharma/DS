## The Bottom Line

**This incident highlighted that payment networks are still vulnerable to single points of hardware failure, despite their critical importance to global commerce.**

**Key Takeaways:**
- Payment networks need redundant hardware across multiple data centers
- 30 minutes of payment downtime can affect hundreds of millions of people
- Physical hardware failures can instantly disable digital payments
- European commerce relies heavily on card payments vs cash
