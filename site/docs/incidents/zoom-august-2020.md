## The Bottom Line

**This incident proved that the shift to remote education created infrastructure demands that no one had planned for.**

**Key Takeaways:**
- Educational technology needs to scale instantly for simultaneous global usage
- Back-to-school periods create unprecedented traffic patterns
- Video conferencing became critical infrastructure during COVID-19
- Capacity planning must account for societal shifts

**The education question:** How do you build infrastructure for 300M students starting school simultaneously?
