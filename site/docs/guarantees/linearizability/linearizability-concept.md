# Linearizability Concept: The Gold Standard of Consistency

## Overview

Linearizability is the strongest consistency model in distributed systems. It guarantees that all operations appear to execute atomically at some point between their start and completion time, creating the illusion of a single, sequential execution.

**Key Insight**: Linearizability makes a distributed system behave like a single-threaded program running on a single machine.

## The Timeline Model

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Timeline[Real Time Timeline]
        T1[t1: Start] --> T2[t2: Op Begins] --> T3[t3: Linearization Point] --> T4[t4: Op Completes] --> T5[t5: End]
    end

    subgraph ClientView[Client Operations View]
        C1[Client A: read(x)]
        C2[Client B: write(x,5)]
        C3[Client C: read(x)]
    end

    subgraph LinearOrder[Linear Order Requirements]
        L1[All ops must appear atomic]
        L2[Order matches real-time]
        L3[Concurrent ops can be ordered arbitrarily]
    end

    subgraph Violations[Common Violations]
        V1[Read returns stale value]
        V2[Operations appear out of order]
        V3[Concurrent ops conflict]
    end

## Production Example: Banking System

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as ATM A
    participant B as ATM B
    participant S as Banking System
    participant D as Database

    Note over A,D: Linearizable Banking Operations

    A->>S: withdraw($100) [t1]
    B->>S: withdraw($50) [t2]

    S->>D: check_balance() → $120

    Note over S,D: Linearization Point: First operation wins

    S-->>A: SUCCESS: $20 remaining [t3]
    S-->>B: FAILURE: Insufficient funds [t4]

    Note over A,D: Timeline: t1 < t2 < t3 < t4
    Note over A,D: Both clients see consistent state
```

## Linearizability Properties

### 1. Real-Time Ordering
If operation A completes before operation B starts, then A appears before B in the linear order.

### 2. Atomicity
Each operation appears to take effect at exactly one point in time (linearization point).

### 3. Consistency
All clients observe the same order of operations.

## Testing Linearizability in Production

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph TestSetup[Linearizability Test Setup]
        G[Operation Generator] --> H[History Recorder]
        H --> V[Validator]
    end

    subgraph Operations[Concurrent Operations]
        R1[read(x) → 5]
        W1[write(x, 10)]
        R2[read(x) → 10]
        W2[write(x, 15)]
    end

    subgraph Validation[Validation Process]
        C[Check all possible<br/>linear orders]
        M[Match observed results<br/>with linear execution]
        P[Pass if match found<br/>Fail otherwise]
    end

## Debugging Linearizability Violations

### Common Symptoms
1. **Dirty Reads**: Client reads uncommitted data
2. **Lost Updates**: Concurrent writes overwrite each other
3. **Read Skew**: Different reads see inconsistent snapshots
4. **Write Skew**: Concurrent transactions violate constraints

### Investigation Checklist
- [ ] Check operation logs for overlapping timestamps
- [ ] Verify consensus algorithm is working correctly
- [ ] Look for network partitions during violations
- [ ] Examine client retry logic for duplicate operations
- [ ] Validate linearization points in the code

## Key Takeaways

1. **Linearizability = Sequential Consistency + Real-Time Ordering**
2. **Every operation has a linearization point where it "takes effect"**
3. **Strong consistency comes at significant performance cost**
4. **Essential for systems where consistency matters more than performance**
5. **Use automated testing tools like Jepsen to verify linearizability**

- **Consensus rounds per operation**
- **Network partition detection time**
