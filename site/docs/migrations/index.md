# Migration Playbooks

> **Production-tested migration strategies from major tech companies**
>
> Every playbook documents real transformations with actual timelines, costs, and lessons learned.

## Overview

This collection documents 20 major production migrations that transformed how companies operate at scale. Each playbook includes:

- **Before/After Architectures** with real metrics
- **Phase-by-phase timelines** from actual implementations
- **Team sizes and organizational changes** required
- **Budget and cost analysis** including overruns
- **Production incidents** that occurred during migration
- **Rollback strategies** and contingency plans
- **Performance improvements** with measured gains

## Featured Migrations

- [Uber: Monolith to Microservices](uber-monolith-to-microservices.md) (2014-2016, 18 months, Complete transformation)
- [Monolith to Microservices](monolith-to-microservices.md) (General patterns and strategies)

### Cloud Migrations
- [On-premise to Cloud](on-premise-to-cloud.md) (General cloud migration strategies)

### Database Transformations

- [PostgreSQL to DynamoDB](postgresql-to-dynamodb.md) (NoSQL migration strategies)
- [LinkedIn Kafka Evolution](linkedin-kafka-evolution.md) (2011-present, Event streaming platform)

### Messaging Migrations
- [Kafka to Kinesis](kafka-to-kinesis.md) (AWS streaming migration)


## Migration Categories

### By Transformation Type
- **Monolith → Microservices**: Uber and other major platforms
- **Cloud Provider**: On-premise to AWS, GCP, Azure migrations
- **Database Platform**: SQL to NoSQL transformations
- **Messaging Systems**: Kafka, Kinesis, and streaming platforms
- **Infrastructure**: Dropbox, WhatsApp
- **Frontend Framework**: Instagram

### By Scale
- **Billion+ Users**: WhatsApp, Instagram, Netflix
- **100M+ Users**: Uber, Twitter, Spotify, GitHub
- **10M+ Users**: Airbnb, Slack, Pinterest, LinkedIn
- **High Volume**: Square, Robinhood (financial), DoorDash (logistics)

### By Duration
- **< 12 months**: Discord, Elasticsearch, WhatsApp
- **12-18 months**: Uber, Shopify, GitHub, Square, Robinhood, Instagram, DoorDash
- **2-3 years**: Twitter, Airbnb, Spotify, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Slack, Dropbox, Reddit, Etsy, Twitch
- **3+ years**: Netflix

## Key Insights

### Success Patterns
1. **Gradual Migration**: Most successful migrations took 12-24 months
2. **Dual-Write Strategy**: Run old and new systems in parallel
3. **Feature Flags**: Enable gradual rollout and instant rollback
4. **Monitoring First**: Instrument before, during, and after
5. **Team Dedication**: Assign 2-5 engineers full-time per migration

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Underestimating Timeline**: Most migrations take 2x initial estimates
2. **Data Migration Complexity**: Often 50% of total migration effort
3. **Integration Testing**: Insufficient testing of edge cases
4. **Rollback Planning**: Not having working rollback after 50% complete
5. **Performance Regression**: New system initially slower than old

### Cost Considerations
- **Infrastructure**: 20-50% increase during dual-run period
- **Engineering**: 2-10 engineers for 12-24 months ($2-10M in salary)
- **Opportunity Cost**: Features not built during migration
- **Risk Mitigation**: Budget 30-50% buffer for timeline overruns

## Quality Gates

Each migration playbook passes these tests:

### The CTO Test
- [ ] Shows actual ROI and business justification
- [ ] Includes real timeline with milestone dependencies
- [ ] Documents team size and skill requirements
- [ ] Quantifies risk and mitigation strategies

### The Engineering Manager Test
- [ ] Realistic project planning with buffers
- [ ] Clear ownership and responsibility matrix
- [ ] Detailed rollback and contingency plans
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and success criteria

### The On-Call Test
- [ ] Production incident scenarios during migration
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting changes required
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides for hybrid state
- [ ] Emergency procedures and escalation paths

### The CFO Test
- [ ] Complete cost breakdown (infrastructure + people)
- [ ] Migration investment vs business value
- [ ] Risk of not migrating (technical debt cost)
- [ ] Comparison with alternative solutions
