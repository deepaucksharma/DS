# Migration Playbooks

> **Production-tested migration strategies from major tech companies**
>
> Every playbook documents real transformations with actual timelines, costs, and lessons learned.

## Overview

This collection documents 20 major production migrations that transformed how companies operate at scale. Each playbook includes:

- **Before/After Architectures** with real metrics
- **Phase-by-phase timelines** from actual implementations
- **Team sizes and organizational changes** required
- **Budget and cost analysis** including overruns
- **Production incidents** that occurred during migration
- **Rollback strategies** and contingency plans
- **Performance improvements** with measured gains

## Key Insights

### Success Patterns
1. **Gradual Migration**: Most successful migrations took 12-24 months
2. **Dual-Write Strategy**: Run old and new systems in parallel
3. **Feature Flags**: Enable gradual rollout and instant rollback
4. **Monitoring First**: Instrument before, during, and after
5. **Team Dedication**: Assign 2-5 engineers full-time per migration

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Underestimating Timeline**: Most migrations take 2x initial estimates
2. **Data Migration Complexity**: Often 50% of total migration effort
3. **Integration Testing**: Insufficient testing of edge cases
4. **Rollback Planning**: Not having working rollback after 50% complete
5. **Performance Regression**: New system initially slower than old

### Cost Considerations
- **Infrastructure**: 20-50% increase during dual-run period
- **Engineering**: 2-10 engineers for 12-24 months ($2-10M in salary)
- **Opportunity Cost**: Features not built during migration
- **Risk Mitigation**: Budget 30-50% buffer for timeline overruns

## Quality Gates
