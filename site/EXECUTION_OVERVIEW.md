# Atlas Execution Overview - Final Consolidated Guide

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Create **900 production-grade Mermaid diagrams** documenting distributed systems that help engineers debug issues at 3 AM.

## 📊 The Reality Check

- **Target**: 900 diagrams
- **Timeline**: 9-12 months (36-52 weeks)
- **Team**: 3-4 engineers at 50% allocation
- **Effort**: 60-80 hours/week combined
- **Per Diagram**: 3-4 hours average (research + creation + validation)

## 🚀 Quick Start Path

### Step 1: Read Core Documents
1. **EXECUTION_MASTER.md** - Understand the full scope
2. **execution/EXECUTION.md** - Learn daily workflow
3. **CLAUDE.md** - Understand project principles

### Step 2: Set Up Your Week
- **Monday**: Planning & source discovery (8-10 hours team)
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: Creation sprint (36-48 hours team)
- **Friday**: Validation & publishing (16-20 hours team)

### Step 3: Start Creating
- Focus on Phase 1: Emergency Response Foundation (Months 1-2)
- Target: 150 diagrams focusing on immediate production value
- Use 4-plane architecture (Edge, Service, State, Control)

## 📈 Phased Approach (9-12 Months)

### Phase 1: Emergency Response (Months 1-2)
- 150 diagrams: Incident response, debugging guides, failure modes
- Output: ~19 diagrams/week

### Phase 2: Core Concepts (Months 3-4)
- 200 diagrams: Guarantees (108), Mechanisms (92)
- Output: ~25 diagrams/week

### Phase 3: Pattern Library (Months 5-6)
- 150 diagrams: Pattern implementations
- Output: ~19 diagrams/week

### Phase 4: Case Studies (Months 7-9)
- 240 diagrams: 30 companies × 8 diagrams each
- Output: ~20 diagrams/week

### Phase 5: Polish & Completeness (Months 10-12)
- 160 diagrams: Performance, migrations, costs, capacity
- Output: ~13 diagrams/week

## ✅ Quality Gates (Every Diagram)

### The 3 AM Test
- Shows exact error messages
- Indicates which logs to check
- Specifies relevant metrics
- Includes recovery procedures

### Production Reality
- Real company names (not "Service A")
- Actual metrics (not "high performance")
- Specific technologies with versions
- Failure scenarios documented

## 🛠️ Available Tools

```bash
# Weekly discovery
python scripts/manual_source_discovery.py

# Progress tracking
python scripts/progress_tracker.py

# Validation
python scripts/validate_mermaid.py
python scripts/check_links.py

# Preview
mkdocs serve
```

## 🎨 Mandatory Standards

### 4-Plane Architecture Colors
- **Edge**: #0066CC (Blue)
- **Service**: #00AA00 (Green)
- **State**: #FF8800 (Orange)
- **Control**: #CC0000 (Red)

### 8 Diagrams Per System
1. Complete Architecture
2. Request Flow
3. Storage Architecture
4. Failure Domains
5. Scale Evolution
6. Cost Breakdown
7. Novel Solutions
8. Production Operations

## 💰 Budget Reality

- **Engineering Time**: $500K-750K (2,400-3,600 hours at $200/hour)
- **Tooling**: $10K
- **Review**: $50K
- **Total**: $560K-810K

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. ❌ Don't create academic diagrams without production metrics
2. ❌ Don't skip the quality gates
3. ❌ Don't use placeholder data
4. ❌ Don't forget failure scenarios
5. ❌ Don't ignore cost information

## ✅ Success Criteria

At completion, we will have:
- 240 Architecture Deep-Dives (30 systems)
- 100 Incident Anatomies
- 100 Debugging Guides
- 80 Scale Journeys
- 80 Performance Profiles
- 80 Pattern Implementations
- 60 Cost Breakdowns
- 60 Migration Playbooks
- 60 Capacity Models
- 40 Technology Comparisons

## 🎯 Final Reminder

**This is not documentation. This is collective production wisdom.**

Every diagram represents real incidents, real costs, real solutions.
