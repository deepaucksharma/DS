# Atlas Community Ecosystem
## Self-Sustaining Learning Community for Distributed Systems Mastery

### Vision

Create a thriving ecosystem where **learners become contributors become teachers**, transforming the Atlas study plan from individual learning into collective wisdom building.

**Core Principle**: Every community member progresses through the same journey:
1. **Week 1-4**: Active Learner (consume content, ask questions)
2. **Week 5-12**: Contributing Learner (improve diagrams, share insights)
3. **Week 13+**: Teaching Learner (mentor others, create content)

### Community Philosophy

**From Consumption to Creation**
- Learners don't just consume diagrams—they improve them
- Questions aren't just answered—they become documentation
- Struggles aren't individual—they become shared solutions
- Success isn't personal—it amplifies the community

**The Contribution Flywheel**
```
Learn → Apply → Struggle → Document → Teach → Learn Deeper
```
