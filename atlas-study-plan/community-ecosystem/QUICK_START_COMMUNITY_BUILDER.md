## COMMON PITFALLS & SOLUTIONS

### Pitfall 1: Over-Promising

**Problem**: Launch with grand vision, can't deliver
**Solution**: Start small, expand based on capacity
**Example**: Don't promise 24/7 support with 2 volunteers

### Pitfall 2: Founder Dependency

**Problem**: Everything depends on you
**Solution**: Distribute leadership from day one
**Example**: Rotate office hours, delegate moderation

### Pitfall 3: Quality Dilution

**Problem**: Accept low-quality contributions for growth
**Solution**: Maintain standards, grow slowly
**Example**: Better 10 great diagrams than 50 mediocre

### Pitfall 4: Burnout

**Problem**: Unsustainable pace in first months
**Solution**: Set boundaries, take breaks, delegate
**Example**: Dedicate Sundays to rest, no community work

### Pitfall 5: Echo Chamber

**Problem**: Only recruit people like you
**Solution**: Actively seek diversity
**Example**: Different experience levels, countries, backgrounds
