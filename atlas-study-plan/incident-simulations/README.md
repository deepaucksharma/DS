# Production Incident Simulation System
## Immersive Training for Real-World Crisis Management

### Overview

This simulation system prepares distributed systems engineers for the reality of production incidents through immersive, stress-tested scenarios based on actual outages from the 30 companies documented in the Atlas framework.

**Core Philosophy**: You can't learn to handle 3 AM production crises by reading theory. You need to simulate the chaos, the pressure, the incomplete information, and the stakeholder demands.

### Training Pathways

| Level | Duration | Scenarios | Success Criteria |
|-------|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Junior (L3-L4)** | 40 hours | 15 scenarios | MTTR <60min, 70% RCA accuracy |
| **Mid-Level (L5)** | 60 hours | 25 scenarios | MTTR <45min, 85% RCA accuracy |
| **Senior (L6+)** | 80 hours | 35 scenarios | MTTR <30min, 95% RCA accuracy |
| **Incident Commander** | 100 hours | 50 scenarios | MTTR <20min, leadership eval |

### Key Features

#### 1. Realistic Time Pressure
- Clock starts immediately when scenario loads
- Real-time alerts continue to fire
- Stakeholders demand updates every 15 minutes
- Performance degrades if not mitigated quickly

#### 2. Incomplete Information
- Monitoring gaps (some metrics missing)
- Conflicting data from different sources
- Red herrings that waste investigation time
- Delayed availability of critical logs

#### 3. Multi-System Complexity
- Cascading failures across services
- Multiple potential root causes
- Cross-team coordination required
- Competing priorities and trade-offs

#### 4. Communication Challenges
- Write status updates for non-technical executives
- Balance transparency with accuracy
- Manage customer expectations
- Coordinate with distributed teams

#### 5. Real-World Constraints
- Budget limits on scaling decisions
- SLA obligations and penalties
- On-call engineer fatigue modeling
- Limited access to production systems

### How to Use This System

#### Solo Practice Mode
1. Choose a scenario based on your level
2. Set a timer and start the simulation
3. Work through the incident using available tools
4. Document your decisions and rationale
5. Compare your approach to the expert solution
6. Review lessons learned and patterns identified

#### Team Practice Mode
1. Assign roles (Incident Commander, Engineers, Communications)
2. Run the scenario with simulated time pressure
3. Practice real-time communication and coordination
4. Make trade-off decisions as a team
5. Conduct blameless postmortem
6. Rotate roles and repeat

#### Assessment Mode
1. Random scenario selection (no preview)
2. Timed performance evaluation
3. Multiple metrics tracked (MTTR, accuracy, communication)
4. Peer review of incident response
5. Certification upon passing all levels
