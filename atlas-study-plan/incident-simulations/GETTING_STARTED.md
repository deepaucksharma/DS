# Getting Started with Incident Simulations
## Your Path to Production Incident Mastery

### Welcome to Battle School

You're about to enter an immersive training program that will prepare you for the reality of production incidents. This isn't theory. This isn't tutorial code. This is as close as you can get to real 3 AM incidents without actually being on-call.

**What You'll Gain**:
- Muscle memory for incident response
- Pattern recognition for failure modes
- Confidence to handle production crises
- Decision-making skills under pressure
- Communication abilities during chaos

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Assess Your Current Level

**Take this 2-minute quiz**:

```yaml
Question 1: When you see "Error rate: 18%", your first action is:
  A) Check recent deployments
  B) Restart all services
  C) Call your manager
  D) Look for patterns in logs

Question 2: Database CPU at 95%, what's most likely?
  A) Need more CPU
  B) Slow query storm
  C) Network issue
  D) Cache problem

Question 3: You have 3 options, all bad. You:
  A) Pick the least bad immediately
  B) Investigate 10 more minutes
  C) Escalate to leadership
  D) Try all three simultaneously

Question 4: CEO joins war room, you:
  A) Give technical details
  B) Provide timeline and plan
  C) Apologize profusely
  D) Say "I don't know yet"

Question 5: Incident resolved, next you:
  A) Go back to sleep
  B) Write postmortem immediately
  C) Schedule postmortem meeting
  D) Update all documentation

Answer Key:
Mostly A's: Senior Level (L6+)
Mostly B's: Mid-Level (L5)
Mostly C's: Junior Level (L3-L4)
Mostly D's: Need fundamentals first
```

**Your Starting Point**:
- **Junior (0-2 years)**: Start with Beginner Path
- **Mid-Level (2-5 years)**: Start with Intermediate Path
- **Senior (5+ years)**: Start with Advanced Path
- **Staff+ (8+ years)**: Start with Incident Commander Track

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment

**Physical Setup** (10 minutes):
```bash
# 1. Create a dedicated workspace
mkdir ~/incident-simulations
cd ~/incident-simulations

# 2. Clone common tools (if you have access)
# Note: Simulations provide sample outputs
git clone https://github.com/your-company/runbooks
git clone https://github.com/your-company/monitoring-dashboards

# 3. Set up monitoring dashboard templates
# Bookmark these URLs:
# - Datadog/Grafana dashboard
# - PagerDuty incidents page
# - Slack war room channel template
# - Company wiki/runbooks

# 4. Prepare your toolbox
cat > ~/.bash_aliases << 'EOF'
alias k='kubectl'
alias kg='kubectl get'
alias kd='kubectl describe'
alias kl='kubectl logs'
alias kgp='kubectl get pods'
alias kgs='kubectl get services'
EOF

source ~/.bashrc
```

**Mental Preparation** (5 minutes):
```yaml
Before Each Simulation:
  - [ ] Clear your calendar (no interruptions)
  - [ ] Close all unrelated tabs
  - [ ] Turn off Slack/notifications (except simulator)
  - [ ] Have water nearby
  - [ ] Bathroom break now

Mindset:
  - This is real (treat it seriously)
  - Mistakes are learning opportunities
  - Speed matters, but accuracy matters more
  - Communication is half the job
  - You will feel uncomfortable (that's the point)
```

### Step 3: Run Your First Simulation (30 minutes)

**Recommended First Scenario**: MS-001 (Azure SQL DTU Exhaustion)

**Why this one?**:
- Single-service failure (not overwhelming)
- Clear symptoms and solution path
- 30-minute duration (manageable)
- Common pattern you'll see again
- Good introduction to methodology

**How to Run It**:

1. **Read the scenario** (5 min):
   - Don't skip ahead to the solution
   - Note your initial hypotheses
   - Write down what you'd check first

2. **Start the timer** (30 min):
   - Set an alarm for 30 minutes
   - Track every action you take
   - Write status updates as you go
   - Make decisions at each decision point

3. **Compare to expert solution** (10 min):
   - How did your path differ?
   - What did you miss?
   - What would you do differently?
   - What did you learn?

4. **Score yourself** (5 min):
   - Use the evaluation rubric
   - Be honest about mistakes
   - Note areas for improvement

```

### 3 AM Training (Monthly)

**Once Per Month**:
```yaml
True 3 AM Simulation:

  - Experience real cognitive impairment
  - Learn to function under fatigue

Progression:
  Month 1: Mid-level scenario
  Month 2: Senior scenario

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: "I'm Overwhelmed"

**Symptoms**: Scenarios feel too hard, making too many mistakes, want to quit

**Solution**:
```yaml
Step Back:
  1. You're probably starting too advanced
  2. Drop down one difficulty level
  3. Master fundamentals first

Strategy:
  - Do the same scenario 3 times
  - Each time, improve one aspect
  - Build confidence before advancing

Remember:
  "Experts are just beginners who kept practicing"
```

### Challenge 2: "I'm Not Improving"

**Symptoms**: MTTR plateaued, scores not increasing, frustrated

**Solution**:
```yaml
Diagnose:
  1. Are you studying the solutions deeply?
  2. Are you practicing similar patterns?
  3. Are you building mental models?

Fix:
  - After each scenario, write a 1-page summary
  - Focus on "why" not just "what"
  - Teach the pattern to someone else
  - Take a 1-week break, then retry

Advanced Technique:
  - Record yourself doing a scenario
  - Watch the replay
  - Identify decision points
  - Analyze your thought process
```

### Challenge 3: "I Can't Find Time"

**Symptoms**: Too busy, always behind, scenarios pile up

**Solution**:
```yaml
Minimum Viable Practice:
  - 2 scenarios per week = 8/month
  - 15-20 minutes each
  - 40 minutes/week total

Quality > Quantity:
  - 1 scenario done well > 3 done poorly
  - Full focus for 30 minutes
  - Better than distracted 2 hours

Accountability:
  - Schedule it like a meeting
  - Practice with a buddy
  - Join a study group
  - Public commitment
```

  Cons: Scheduling conflicts

Small Group (3-5 people):
  Pros: Multiple perspectives, role-playing
  Cons: Coordination overhead

Format:
  - Weekly sync (30 min)
  - Share scenario experiences
  - Teach patterns to each other
  - Run team exercises
```

## Success Stories

### Sarah (L4 → L6 in 6 months)

**Before**:
> "I'd panic during incidents. Make random changes. Hope something works. Take 2+ hours to resolve simple issues."

**After 50 Scenarios**:
> "I'm calm now. I have a checklist. I systematically eliminate causes. Average MTTR: 25 minutes. I mentor others."

**Key Insight**:
> "The scenarios taught me it's okay not to know immediately. What matters is having a process."

### Mike (L5 → IC Track)

**Before**:
> "Great at debugging, terrible at communication. Made technical decisions alone. Didn't think about stakeholders."

**After IC Training**:
> "I realized IC is 60% communication, 40% technical. I coordinate teams now. I can translate tech to business."

**Key Insight**:
> "Leadership isn't about being the smartest. It's about making the team effective."

## Final Motivation

**You're About to Join an Elite Group**:

Engineers who can handle 3 AM incidents with confidence are rare. Most engineers panic. Most make it worse. Most take hours to resolve simple issues.

**But you'll be different**.

You'll have practiced 50+ incidents. You'll recognize patterns instantly. You'll execute recovery procedures automatically. You'll communicate clearly under pressure.

**When the real 3 AM page comes**, you'll think:

> "I've seen this before. I know what to do. I've got this."

That confidence comes from deliberate practice. That's what these simulations give you.
