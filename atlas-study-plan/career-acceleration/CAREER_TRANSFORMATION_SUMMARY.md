## Critical Success Factors

### What Determines Your Outcome?

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Solution: Engage communities from Day 1

**The Breadth Trap**: Knowing everything shallowly
- Solution: Go deep on Atlas + one specialization

**The Passive Trap**: Waiting for opportunities
- Solution: Create opportunities through content + network

**The Negotiation Trap**: Accepting first offer
- Solution: Always counter, leverage multiple offers

**The Burnout Trap**: Unsustainable pace
- Solution: Adjust timeline, take breaks, maintain health
