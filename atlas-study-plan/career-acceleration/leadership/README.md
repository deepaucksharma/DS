# Leadership Development
## From Individual Contributor to Technical Leader

### Overview

The Leadership Development module transforms you from a strong individual contributor into a senior/staff-level technical leader who influences teams, organizations, and the industry.

**Impact**: Transition to Staff+ roles ($400K-$700K+), organizational influence, and career optionality (IC vs Management paths).

---

## Leadership vs Management

### The Individual Contributor (IC) Leadership Path

**IC Leadership (Staff+)**:
- Lead through technical excellence
- Influence without direct reports
- Shape technical direction
- Mentor and grow others
- Drive cross-team initiatives
- Maintain hands-on technical work

**Management Path**:
- Lead through people
- Direct reports and team building
- Operational responsibility
- Career development focus
- Less hands-on technical work
- Budget and planning

**This module focuses on IC Leadership** - how to reach Staff/Principal/Distinguished Engineer levels.
