# 16-Week Intensive Protocol
## Complete Phase-by-Phase Execution Guide

### Overview

The 16-week intensive protocol is designed for **career transformation** through distributed systems mastery. This timeline assumes **40-56 hours per week** of dedicated study and follows a carefully sequenced curriculum for maximum retention and practical application.

## Phase Structure

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Diagrams | Hours |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|-------|
| **[Phase 1](./phase-1-foundations.md)** | Weeks 1-2 | Foundations & Patterns | 240 | 80-90 |
| **[Phase 2](./phase-2-performance.md)** | Weeks 3-6 | Performance & Scale | 280 | 160-180 |
| **[Phase 3](./phase-3-companies.md)** | Weeks 7-10 | Company Deep-Dives | 240 | 160-180 |
| **[Phase 4](./phase-4-production.md)** | Weeks 11-14 | Production Wisdom | 200 | 120-140 |
| **[Phase 5](./phase-5-integration.md)** | Weeks 15-16 | Integration & Mastery | 100 | 60-80 |

**Total**: 900 diagrams in 580-670 hours over 16 weeks

## Emergency Protocols

### If Behind Schedule (1 week)
1. **Prioritize core diagrams** (skip variations)
2. **Increase daily hours** temporarily
3. **Focus on retention** over perfection
4. **Seek help** from study group/mentor

### If Behind Schedule (2+ weeks)
1. **Switch to Balanced path** (32 weeks)
2. **Reassess time commitment** and constraints
3. **Adjust expectations** while maintaining quality
4. **Consider Extended path** (52 weeks)

### If Struggling with Retention
1. **Increase spaced repetition** frequency
2. **Add more active recall** practice
3. **Implement teach-back** sessions
4. **Review learning techniques** and adapt

### If Motivation Drops
1. **Connect with study group** for support
2. **Review progress** and celebrate wins
3. **Revisit career goals** and motivation
4. **Take strategic break** if needed
