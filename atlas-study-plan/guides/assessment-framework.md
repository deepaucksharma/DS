# Assessment Framework & Skills Validation
## Comprehensive Progress Measurement System

### Overview

This framework provides systematic assessment tools for validating distributed systems mastery across four competency levels. Each assessment is designed to measure both theoretical knowledge and practical application skills, ensuring comprehensive readiness for real-world challenges.

**Assessment Philosophy**: Skills are validated through practical application rather than rote memorization. Every assessment simulates real-world scenarios where the knowledge would be applied.
