# Study Groups & Peer Learning
## Collaborative Learning Features

### Executive Summary

Study Groups enable learners to connect, collaborate, and learn together. By forming cohorts around shared goals, learners benefit from peer support, shared insights, and accountability partnerships that dramatically improve completion rates and knowledge retention.

**Research**: Collaborative learning increases completion rates by 3x and retention by 40%.

## üéØ Core Features

### 1. Study Group Formation
**Auto-matching algorithm**:
```typescript
interface StudyGroupMatch {
  findCompatiblePeers(userId: string): Promise<User[]> {
    const profile = await getUserProfile(userId);

    return await db.users.find({
      // Similar skill level (¬±1 level)
      skillLevel: { $in: [profile.skillLevel - 1, profile.skillLevel, profile.skillLevel + 1] },

      // Similar goals
      goals: { $in: profile.goals },

      // Compatible schedule
      timezone: { $within: 3 }, // within 3 hours

      // Active learners
      lastActive: { $gte: Date.now() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 }
    })
    .limit(10)
    .sort({ compatibilityScore: -1 });
  }
}
```
