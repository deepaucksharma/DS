# Atlas Distributed Systems Mastery Study Plan
## 900-Diagram Framework with Complete Task Management System

### Executive Summary

This study plan integrates the **Atlas Distributed Systems Architecture Framework** (900 diagrams) into a comprehensive learning system designed to achieve 95%+ retention while respecting cognitive limits. Every diagram focuses on production reality - helping you debug issues at 3 AM, design systems that scale, and make architectural decisions with confidence.

**🎯 Total Scope: 900 Production Diagrams**
- **240** Company Architecture Diagrams (30 companies × 8 diagrams each)
- **100** Incident Anatomy Diagrams (real production failures)
- **100** Debugging Guide Diagrams (troubleshooting flowcharts)
- **80** Scale Journey Diagrams (growth evolution patterns)
- **80** Performance Profile Diagrams (bottleneck analyses)
- **80** Pattern Implementation Diagrams (20 patterns × 4 variations)
- **60** Cost Breakdown Diagrams (infrastructure economics)
- **60** Migration Playbook Diagrams (transformation strategies)
- **60** Capacity Model Diagrams (planning frameworks)
- **40** Technology Comparison Diagrams (trade-off analyses)

## 🔗 Integration with Atlas Framework

This study plan is designed to work alongside the [Atlas Distributed Systems Framework](../site/) documentation:

### Study Plan → Atlas Mapping
- **Patterns (Week 1-2)** → [`/site/docs/patterns/`](../site/docs/patterns/)
- **Companies (Week 7-10)** → [`/site/docs/systems/`](../site/docs/systems/)
- **Incidents (Week 11-12)** → [`/site/docs/incidents/`](../site/docs/incidents/)
- **Debugging (Week 13-14)** → [`/site/docs/debugging/`](../site/docs/debugging/)
- **Performance (Week 5-6)** → [`/site/docs/performance/`](../site/docs/performance/)

### Atlas Framework Sections
- **[Foundation](../site/docs/foundation/)** - Universal laws, capabilities, primitives
- **[Guarantees](../site/docs/guarantees/)** - System promises (consistency, availability)
- **[Mechanisms](../site/docs/mechanisms/)** - Implementation details (consensus, replication)
- **[Examples](../site/docs/examples/)** - Real implementations and pitfalls

## 🎯 The 3 AM Test

Every diagram in this study plan passes the **3 AM Production Test**:
- ✅ Shows exact error messages to look for
- ✅ Indicates which logs to check
- ✅ Specifies metrics that indicate issues
- ✅ Includes recovery procedures
- ✅ References real production incidents
