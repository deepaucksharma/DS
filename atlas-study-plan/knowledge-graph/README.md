# Atlas Knowledge Graph System
## Semantic Network for 900-Diagram Distributed Systems Mastery

### Overview

The Atlas Knowledge Graph is a comprehensive semantic network that maps relationships between 500+ distributed systems concepts, 80 architectural patterns, 30 company architectures, 100 incidents, and all supporting knowledge across the 900-diagram framework. This system reveals hidden connections, accelerates learning, and enables intelligent query capabilities.

### Purpose

Transform the linear study plan into a multi-dimensional knowledge network that:
- **Reveals Hidden Connections**: Discover how concepts relate across different contexts
- **Optimizes Learning Paths**: Find shortest routes to specific knowledge goals
- **Accelerates Understanding**: See pattern relationships and evolution trajectories
- **Enables Intelligent Search**: Query by concept, company, failure mode, or optimization
- **Predicts Mastery**: Calculate time-to-proficiency based on prerequisite chains
- **Identifies Gaps**: Highlight missing knowledge in learning journey

### Quick Start

#### Option 1: Neo4j Database (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Neo4j
docker run -d \
  --name atlas-neo4j \
  -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
  -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/atlas123 \
  neo4j:latest

# Load schema and data
python scripts/load_knowledge_graph.py

# Query via Cypher
neo4j-shell -u neo4j -p atlas123
```

#### Option 2: NetworkX (Python)
```python
import networkx as nx
from knowledge_graph import AtlasGraph

# Load graph
graph = AtlasGraph.from_yaml('data/')

# Query concepts
path = graph.shortest_learning_path('CAP Theorem', 'Raft Consensus')

# Find patterns
patterns = graph.find_patterns_for_scenario('High Availability')

# Compare architectures
similarities = graph.compare_architectures('Netflix', 'Uber')
```

#### Option 3: GraphQL API
```bash
# Start API server
python api/graphql_server.py

# Query via GraphQL
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ concept(name: \"CAP Theorem\") { prerequisites { name } } }"}'
```

### Example Queries

```cypher
MATCH (c:Company)-[:USES_PATTERN]->(p:Pattern {name: 'Raft Consensus'})
RETURN c.name, c.scale, c.use_case
```

#### Show Learning Path from Beginner to Expert
```cypher
MATCH path = shortestPath(
  (start:Concept {name: 'HTTP Basics'})-[:PREREQUISITE_FOR*]->(end:Concept {name: 'Distributed Transactions'})
)
RETURN [node in nodes(path) | node.name] AS learning_path,
       reduce(time = 0, n in nodes(path) | time + n.learning_hours) AS total_hours
```

#### Compare Caching Strategies Across Companies
```cypher
MATCH (c:Company)-[:IMPLEMENTS]->(cache:Pattern)
