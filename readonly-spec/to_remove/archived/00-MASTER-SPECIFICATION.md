# Master Specification: GitHub Pages Atlas v5.0
## Ultra-Detailed Distributed Systems Architecture Framework with Massively Scalable Architectures (2020-2025)

### Executive Summary

This document specifies a GitHub Pages site containing **2,000+ ultra-detailed Mermaid diagrams and structured tables** documenting distributed systems architecture through the lens of **Guarantees → Mechanisms → Patterns** ontology, with comprehensive coverage of **120+ massively scalable architectures from 2020-2025**. The site emphasizes real-world implementations with verified scale metrics, automated source discovery, and confidence-based documentation.

## Core Ontology

### 1. Three-Layer Architecture Model

```
GUARANTEES (What we promise)
    ↓ requires
MECHANISMS (How we deliver)
    ↓ compose into
PATTERNS (When and where to apply)
```

### 2. Five Control Planes

| Plane | Color | Responsibility | Latency Budget | Failure Domain |
|-------|-------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Edge** | Blue (#0066CC) | Request routing, admission control | 1-5ms | Cell-scoped |
| **Service** | Green (#00AA00) | Business logic, orchestration | 10-50ms | Region-scoped |
| **Stream** | Purple (#AA00AA) | Event processing, async workflows | 100-500ms | Global async |
| **State** | Orange (#FF8800) | Persistence, consistency | 5-20ms | Partition-scoped |
| **Control** | Red (#CC0000) | Configuration, monitoring, chaos | 1000-5000ms | Meta-plane |

### 3. Universal Convergence Architecture

Every system converges to this structure at scale:

```
[Clients] → [Edge Plane] → [Service Plane] → [State Plane]
                ↓                   ↓              ↓
           [Control Plane] ← [Stream Plane] ← [Monitoring]
```

## Foundational Principles

### P1: Ends Before Means
- Every diagram MUST declare guarantees it supports
- Every guarantee MUST have verification methods
- Every mechanism MUST specify requires/provides contracts

### P2: Progressive Disclosure
- L0: Global view (80-120 nodes)
- L1: Per-plane zoom (40-80 nodes)
- L2: Mechanism detail (20-40 nodes)
- L3: Edge policy detail (configs)
- L4: Failure sequences

### P3: Composable Templates
- All diagrams generated from YAML data
- Standard Mermaid templates per diagram type
- Strict schema validation

### P4: Capability Contracts
- Every boundary labels requires/provides
- Invalid compositions explicitly marked
- Composition rules enforced

### P5: Proof Hooks
- Every diagram includes SLO labels
- Every decision node has triggers
- Every guarantee has test sequences

### P6: Backpressure Everywhere
- Admission control at entry
- Queue management throughout
- Rate limiting per tenant
- Timeout cascades
- Circuit breaker chains
- Brownout/shedding policies

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- 1,500+ diagrams rendered without errors
- 100% schema validation pass rate
- < 2 second page load time
- < 500KB per diagram after optimization
- 100% link resolution

### Qualitative
- Any distributed system designable using only this reference
- Every failure mode documented with mitigation
- Every guarantee provable via documented tests
- Every pattern traceable to production usage
- Zero ambiguity in composition rules

## Governance

### Change Control
- All changes via PR with diagram diff visualization
- Breaking changes require major version bump
- New patterns require 3+ production references
- Invalid compositions must be explicitly documented

### Quality Review
- Automated: Schema, compilation, size, links
- Manual: Accuracy, completeness, clarity
- Production: Validation against real systems
