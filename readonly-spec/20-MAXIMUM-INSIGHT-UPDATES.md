## 📊 Enhanced Diagram Categories

### Category 1: Reality Over Theory (ROT-*)

Every theoretical diagram gets a reality overlay showing:
- Where it breaks in production
- Actual vs promised performance
- Hidden costs and complexity

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "ROT-01: CAP Theorem Reality"
        subgraph "What We Teach"
            CAP[Choose 2 of 3:<br/>Consistency<br/>Availability<br/>Partition Tolerance]
        end

        subgraph "What Actually Happens"
            REALITY[You Get:<br/>Degraded Consistency<br/>Partial Availability<br/>Partition Confusion]

            EXAMPLES[DynamoDB: Eventually → 5s lag under load<br/>Cassandra: Quorum → Split brain possible<br/>MongoDB: Primary → 30s failover gap]
        end

        subgraph "The Hidden Fourth Dimension"
            LATENCY[Latency Tax:<br/>Strong Consistency = +100ms<br/>Multi-Region = +200ms<br/>Global = +500ms]
        end

        CAP --> REALITY
        REALITY --> EXAMPLES
        EXAMPLES --> LATENCY
    end
```

### Category 2: Scale Transition Points (STP-*)

Document exact moments where architectures must fundamentally change:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "STP-01: Database Scale Transitions"
        S1[1-10K QPS<br/>Single PostgreSQL<br/>$500/mo]

        S2[10-100K QPS<br/>Read Replicas<br/>+ Redis Cache<br/>$5K/mo]

        S3[100K-1M QPS<br/>Sharded Cluster<br/>+ Multi-tier Cache<br/>$50K/mo]

        S4[1M+ QPS<br/>NoSQL + CQRS<br/>+ Edge Cache<br/>$500K/mo]

        S1 ==>|"CPU >80%"| S2
        S2 ==>|"Replication Lag >1s"| S3
        S3 ==>|"Coordination Overhead"| S4

        S1 -.->|"10x cost"| S2
        S2 -.->|"10x cost"| S3
        S3 -.->|"10x cost"| S4
    end
```

### Category 3: Hidden Dependencies (HD-*)

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "HD-01: Microservices Hidden Coupling"
        subgraph "Visible Architecture"
            U[User Service]
            O[Order Service]
            P[Payment Service]
            I[Inventory Service]
        end

        subgraph "Hidden Runtime Dependencies"
            U -.->|"Shared Redis<br/>Key Collision"| O
            O -.->|"Database FK<br/>Lock Wait"| P
            P -.->|"Sync Callback<br/>Timeout Chain"| I
            I -.->|"Event Ordering<br/>Race Condition"| U
        end

        subgraph "Cascade Under Load"
            TRIGGER[Black Friday Load] -->|"Redis Eviction"| CASCADE[All Services Fail Together]
        end
    end

    style CASCADE fill:#ff0000
```

### Category 4: Cost Reality (CR-*)

Show true costs including hidden operational expenses:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "CR-01: True Cost of 5 Nines"
        subgraph "Infrastructure"
            I1[Active-Active: $100K/mo]
            I2[Multi-Region: $50K/mo]
            I3[Redundancy: $30K/mo]
        end

        subgraph "Operational"
            O1[24/7 On-call: $40K/mo]
            O2[Monitoring: $20K/mo]
            O3[Testing: $15K/mo]

            OC2[Complex Debugging: $50K/mo]
            OC3[Hiring Difficulty: $100K/mo]
        end

        TOTAL[Total: $605K/mo<br/>For 5 mins less downtime<br/>vs 4 nines]
    end

    style TOTAL fill:#ff8800

  Bottom: "Justin Bieber tweet breaks shard"
```

### Type 2: The Time Bomb

```yaml
Shows degradation over time:
  Hour 1: System deployed, metrics green
  Day 1: Memory usage growing slowly
  Week 1: GC pauses increasing
  Month 1: First timeout errors
  Month 3: Cascading failures begin
  Month 6: Complete system failure
```

### Type 3: The Butterfly Effect

```yaml
Shows how small changes cascade:
  Initial: Add 10ms latency to one service
  Step 1: Downstream timeout increases
  Step 2: Retry rate doubles
  Step 3: Queue depth triples
  Step 4: Memory pressure increases
  Step 5: GC storms begin
  Step 6: Total system collapse

## 🎯 The Ultimate Goal

Transform the readonly-spec from:
**"How distributed systems should work"**

To:
**"Why distributed systems break, how much they cost, and what actually saves you at 3 AM"**

Every diagram should make an engineer say:
- "That's exactly what happened to us!"
- "I wish I knew this before our outage"
- "This would have saved us $100K"
- "This is why our migration failed"

*"The most valuable documentation isn't about success - it's about failure, cost, and evolution."*
