# Parallel Execution Plan v6.0
## Streamlined Multi-Agent Implementation Strategy for 900-1,500 Diagrams

### Executive Summary

This document provides realistic execution plans designed for parallel implementation by multiple agents focused on content creation over infrastructure complexity. The streamlined approach emphasizes direct diagram authoring using markdown + Mermaid, realistic resource allocation, and achievable parallelization to deliver 900-1,500 comprehensive diagrams in 12 weeks.
